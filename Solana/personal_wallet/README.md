It does three things:

1. Create a new wallet.
2. Import any old wallet.
3. Request an airdrop in wallet.
4. Get the balance of your wallet.

## What are wallets?

Wallets are either physical devices or virtual programs that store a unique public key, your "address," and a private key, or the key that begets ownership of the wallet. Now, a key is simply a very very large number that is unique to you. 

Wallets allow you to receive cryptocurrencies by exposing your public key, and you can send cryptocurrencies with the private key.  

In addition to transactions, a wallet also allows for the encrypting of data and the signing of documents where your signature is tied to your public key.
